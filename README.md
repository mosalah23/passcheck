# passcheck
This project is one of the best and safest way to check if your password has ever been pawned before.

We take the data from pwnedpasswords.com API, hash it with sha1 hash algorithm so it can never be known
or traced and then perform a check test
that compares it with all the relevant hashes from the API.
